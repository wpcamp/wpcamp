# Will Campbell

Hi, I'm Will Campbell! I'm a full stack engineer with a degree in Environmental Science and Economics from Colby College. 
         I was born in NYC, grew up in Norwich, Vermont and have also lived in Cambridge, England and Salamanca, Spain. 
          In 2023, after graduating from college and finishing 6 months of backpacking across Europe and Asia, I pursued my passion for software engineering by enrolling in a full-time, full stack bootcamp at App Academy. 
          During my time there, I honed my technical skills and gained significant experience in JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and other technologies. 
          Currently, I'm actively self-learning Solidity.
          In my free time I love long-distance hiking, exploring new cuisines, playing squash, bocce, skiing, and listening to podcasts.
          Welcome to my page!
