# Will Campbell

I'm a full stack engineer with a degree in Environmental Science and Economics from Colby College. 
In 2023, after graduating from college and finishing 6 months of backpacking across Europe and Asia, I pursued my passion for software engineering by enrolling in a full-time, full stack bootcamp at App Academy. 
During my time there, I honed my technical skills and gained significant experience in JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and other technologies. 
In my free time I love long-distance hiking, exploring new cuisines, playing squash, bocce, skiing, and listening to podcasts.
